/*CONNECT TO THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE SERVER VIA PSQL
** In PostgreSQL, a user account is referred to as a role. By default, PostgreSQL uses ident authentication.
** It means that PostgreSQL will associate its roles with the system accounts of Linux. 
** If a role exists in PostgreSQL, the same Linux user account with the same name is able to log in as that role.
** When you installed PostgreSQL, the installation process created a user account called postgres associated with the default postgres role.
*/
-- To connect to PostgreSQL using the postgres role, you switch over to the postgres account on your server by typing:
	sudo -i -u postgres
-- Then, you can access the PostgreSQL using the psql by typing the following command:
	psql
-- Youâ€™ll access the postgres prompt like this, and From here, you can interact with the PostgreSQL like issuing a query.
	postgres=#

/*
There are four levels of organisation in Pg:

^ Cluster - controlled by the postmaster, accepts connections on a given IP/port combo, contains one or more databases including the built-in template0, template1 and postgres databases. Controlled by postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf. Your DB cluster is often created for you by an installer or package. Not to be confused with the normal meaning of cluster as a compute cluster or the general english language meaning.

^ Database - contains one or more schemata or schemas. You connect to a specific database when connecting to Pg.

^ Schema - contains objects including relations. If you do not specify otherwise, anything user-created goes into the public schema. Queries can reference objects in multiple schema explicitly or, via search_path, implicitly.

^ Objects - Somewhat PostgreSQL specific, anything (including a relation) that exists in a schema.

    + Relations - Things that look and behave like tables, like views and tables
    + Other objects also reside in schemas, like functions, casts, indexes, sequences, operators, aggregates, etc.
